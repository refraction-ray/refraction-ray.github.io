**See the repo [here](https://github.com/refraction-ray/wos-statistics).**

## Installation

â˜›  `pip install pywos`

Since the builtin asyncio primitive is utilized, only python 3.6 and above are supported.

Now, it is time to say goodbye to the slow web interface of web of science and wasting time counting citations manually.
