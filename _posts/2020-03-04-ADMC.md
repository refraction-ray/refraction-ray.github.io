## Conclusion

We presented the general theory and framework of ADMC. We also showed how Monte Carlo expectations, KL divergence, and objectives from various settings can be expressed in an infinitely AD aware fashion. We further applied the ADMC approach on various Monte Carlo applications including classical Monte Carlo and end-to-end VMC. Especially, the ADVMC enables us to efficiently study interacting quantum models in higher dimensions.

We believe that the ADMC approach can inspire more accurate and efficient Monte Carlo designs with machine learning toolbox in the future. At the intersection of differentiable programming and probabilistic programming, ADMC framework provides a promising route to advance Monte Carlo applications in the fields of statistics, machine learning, and physics.
