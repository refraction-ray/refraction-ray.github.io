**See the repo [here](https://github.com/refraction-ray/vm-cluster).**

**And the website on <https://myarxiv.club>**.

This is a full stack web app that utilized various technology stacks, including docker, docker-compose, nginx, gunicorn, supervisor, mysql, redis, celery, flask, sqlalchemy, alembic, pytest, vue.js, uikit3, webpack4 etc. For the philosophy on the architecture of this web app, see [this post](/基于-Flask-的网站开发实践-宏观篇/).

The backend engine employed various NLP techniques such as rake and fuzzy matching. For more NLP attempts on arXiv data, see [this post](/Some-NLP-tasks-on-arXiv-data/).

The website is deployed via cloudflare CDN with nginx alone at VPS in the US, while the app is actually running on the machine back in China.
