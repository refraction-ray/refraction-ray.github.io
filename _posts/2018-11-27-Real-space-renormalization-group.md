This project is the backend of the following papers:

1. S.-X. Zhang and H. Yao, Phys. Rev. Lett. **121**, 206601 (2018).
2. S.-X. Zhang and H. Yao, arXiv:1906.00971.


This package is supported for \*nix systems including supercomputers with MPI interface. For the workflow to apply this package on Tianhe-II supercomputer, please refer to [this blog](/高性能科学计算实践) (in chinese).

Below are some nice physics pictures obtained via real space RG.
