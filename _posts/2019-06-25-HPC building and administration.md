I built IASTU-HPC2 mini cluster in Tsinghua University and I am the only administrator of this cluster. Besides I am also one of the administrators of another larger cluster, and I offer suggestions on HPC issues for several clients, both from the user's and administrator's perspective.

IASTU-HPC2 has exploited various modern technology stacks that are rare in conventional HPC style clusters, including an extensive usage of cgroup, tinc, spack, ansible, container, ELK stack and so on.

Below are some materials on IASTU-HPC2, and most of them can be easily generalized to other HPC style clusters.
