**See the repo [here](https://github.com/refraction-ray/tensorcircuit).**

Try the package by ``pip install tensorcircuit``.

Simple API for circuit model with tensor network engine powered by Goolge's Tensor Network package. It also provides unified API for AD such that the code can be written once and run on different backends such as Tensorflow, Pytorch and Jax.
